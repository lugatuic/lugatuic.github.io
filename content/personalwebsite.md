Hi. I'm Kevin

- Likes Linux
- Might be good at it

## Our Credentials

Here are our personal websites:  
Nandana : https://nandana.dev  
Kevin : https://olympicene.dev

Here are some other personal website from our friends we thought you might like:  
Flori (WiCS Dev Lead) : https://cheetodustflori.github.io/Personal-Website  
Megha Nayar (UIC student) : https://meghanayar.com

## Expectations
__This is not a tutorial.__ We're not gonna teach you React or any other framework.  
We're going over the process of building a person website from inspiration, design, developement, and deployment. In addition we'll give you some structure on where to start as well as some additional resources/ general advice.

## Why should you build your own website?
It's a personal showcase of you. You can show off literally anything. Past projects, your resume/achievements, a blog, games, links to other social media.   
It's also a great side project to begin with. We all want to build our own projects outside of school and a personal website is a great place to start. A static website is one of hte simplest things to build.  
__Also, recruiters love it.__  
Every Internship application asks for a 'Personal Website URL'

## Why not just use Workpress/Squarespace
Three main reasons. First off you miss out on important technical skills. The experience you gain from creating designing and deploying a website is huge. Second is you are limited in your creativity. You can make whatever you want and using a tool only limits what you can do. If you know the tools you can literally make whatever you want. And lastly is paywalls. All these tools are open source why should you pay for using them?

## Build Process

### Inspiration

Everyone needs inspiration don't just copy entire websites, steal individual ideas.  

Kevin's Inspiration:
- https://ttntm.me/
- http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/
- Kept track of their inspiration with a list of bookmarks gathered in a doc.

Nandana’s Inspiration:
- https://v4.brittanychiang.com/
- https://www.taniarascia.com/
- Kept track of ideas through Figma

Other Resources for Inspiration:
- https://aboutideasnow.com An index of other personal websites
- https://webdesignmuseum.org
See how design has changed over time

### Design

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is a powerful tool for designing websites. Both of us used Figma, but neither of use started in Figma

Kevin's Design Start:
- Did not have a clear ideas of what I wanted
- Combined components of sites that I was inspired by
- Slowly understood what I liked
- Finalized on having Blog, Links,Projects, and Resume,


Nandana’s Design Start:
- Knew what I wanted to show first: Aboue me, Experience, Projects, Resume, Leadership
- Drew abstracts ideas of what each page should look based off inspiration

After putting some ideas on paper, you have to decide more general aspects of your website. For example:

Color Pallete: https://coolors.co  
Contrast Check: https://realtimecolors.com  
Fonts: https://fonts.google.com

Design Demos:

- [Nandana](https://www.figma.com/design/1vmCPqD24Zb9LzfLAcdZyr/nandana.dev?node-id=0-1&t=H7UbAPrrVmPziP4z-1)
- [Flori](https://www.figma.com/design/IWHFUp2ntpZHx991wrDvN3/personal-website?node-id=0-1&t=nXk7Asqfz5NJfdCU-1)

General Notes:

#### Design with Intention
First understand the goals of your project then design along those constraints

#### Be Realistic
Be aware of your own abilities but don’t be afraid to experiment with new things!

#### As Detailed as Possible
It’s not a priority but a concise vision really makes development easy

How to learn Figma? Just play around with it, its very intuitive. You may want to look at a tutorial but you really don't need to finish it to begin prototyping on Figma.
