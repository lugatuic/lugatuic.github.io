# Preface
This website is unique in that there is *no* content management system or
traditional static site generator backing it! Instead, there is a
[Makefile](make.html) that emulates the task of a static site generator
using `pandoc`'s extensive format conversion and templating. Currently both
`.org` and `.md` files have first-class support for content.

# Contributing
## Prerequisites
1. Text editor with support for either Markdown or Org-mode files. Common
   recommendations include [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), `vim`, or
   `emacs`.
2. Basic usage of [Git](git2.html).

## Adding Content
1. Fork the [website repo](https://github.com/lugatuic/lugatuic.github.io) and make a
   development branch to pull-request from later.
2. Create a new `.md` or `.org` file in `content/`.
3. For every content file, include a header with a title, date, and author.
   Samples are provided below.
   - Markdown
   ```md

4. Write out your content. You can reference other content files with a link
   (so a file like `content/a.md` would be referenced as `a.html` in your
   hyperlink). If you have static content, make a folder with the name of your
   content file and reference them from `static/<name of your content
   file>/<static file>`. Put your static content in the `static/` folder with
   the equivalent folder structure.
5. Build the website by using `make`. The default `all` rule builds the entire
   site. You can then view your added content by opening a browser on
   `public/index.html`. You can use `make clean` aswell to clean all build
   artifacts.
6. Once you are satisfied with the look of your contribution, push and submit a
   [pull request](https://github.com/lugatuic/lugatuic.github.io/pulls)!
