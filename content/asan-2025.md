# Metadata

This is a quick-and-dirty writeup for a presentation on the Address Sanitizer, a topic I learned about for my final interview at Apple. I had a lot of fun!

- I hinted that [the bit on use-after-return](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerExampleUseAfterReturn) is interesting, it is!

- A fun exercise to practice understanding - look at the generated assembly for a simple program with ASan, and see how it instrumented the loads and stores. Try to figure out the actual number ASan uses for the offset on your machine by comparing the code with the code from the slides!
