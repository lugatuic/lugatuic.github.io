** How does Git work?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: how-does-git-work
   :END:
Inside Git, everything is an object.

*** Git objects
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: git-objects
    :END:
Everything in Git is represented in a few basic objects stored in the
file system in the =.git= directory.

**** Blob
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: blob
     :END:
- Data (code, pictures, etc.)

**** Tree
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: tree
     :END:
- Pointers to files, content and other trees

*** Git and Graphs
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: git-and-graphs
    :END:
A Git repository is essentially a giant
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph][directed acyclic
graph (DAG)]].

*** SHA1
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: sha1
    :END:
Every object is stored on disk and has a SHA-1 hash as the filename.

**** But isn't SHA1 insecure?
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: but-isnt-sha1-insecure
     :END:
Yes, but that does not matter in this context. Git uses SHA1 to keep
track of data and check integrity. It is still a good hashing algorithm
with a very-very low collision rate.

*** Content is King
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: content-is-king
    :END:
Git is very smart. It does not keep track of files, it keeps track of
the content. If you create 1000000000000 files with the same content, it
will only create 1 blob. Also works if you create 2 files with the same
content. :wink:
