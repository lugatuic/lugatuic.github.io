# Current Board
- President: [Ethan Wong](mailto:ewong25@uic.edu)
- Vice President: [Jacob Cohen](mailto:jcohen30@uic.edu)
- Treasurer: [Kevin Cordero](mailto:kcord2@uic.edu)

If you wish to reach out to the board, feel free to either email us directly or
through our listserv ([lug-officers@uic.edu](mailto:lug-officers@uic.edu)).

## Announcements
For announcements and newsletters, our predominant method of communication is
the [Discord](https://discord.gg/Edrb8ASX7m). However, we also have a
[newsletter listserv](mailto:lug@listserv.uic.edu). You can join by emailing
`SUBSCRIBE LUG` to `listserv@uic.edu`.


Additionally, there exists a (mostly archived)
[CampusGroups newsletter](https://uic.campusgroups.com/linuxuser/club_signup)
provided by the university's CampusGroups service. Announcements have been
superceded with the Discord and `lug@listserv.uic.edu` listserv instead.

## Location
LUG shares an office with [ACM@UIC](https://acm.cs.uic.edu/) in SELE 2264 where
most of the active members of both orgs hang out. Feel free to drop by!
