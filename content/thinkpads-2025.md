# History by Example

## Pre-Lenovo

Up until 2005, IBM manufactured ThinkPads as part of their PC
hardware division.

Then, IBM sold their PC hardware division to Lenovo, who has been
producing ThinkPads since.

## New(-er) Generations

# Hardware Modding

## Modding

- Older models can flash a custom BIOS[^3]
