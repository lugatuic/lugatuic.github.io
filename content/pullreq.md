# What are they?

1.  Also known as \"Merge Requests\"

2.  Fork a repo and make changes locally

3.  push changes to the fork repo

4.  request if your changes can join main repo

5.  merged into main repo

## First hand experience

You get to contribute!

### Where to start?

1.  Draft your request

    1.  Don't be lazy.

    2.  Details, they are important.

2.  Now it's the main developer(s) turn

    1.  They have final say on your pull requests

    2.  If you made a good pull request it gets merged

    3.  If you don't it gets denied

    **WARNING PLEASE CHECK FOR UPDATES TO THE MAIN REPO BEFORE DOING A
    PULL REQUEST!**

### What happens if a bad pull requests get through?

1.  Merge conflicts

2.  headaches everywhere

3.  lots of yelling and screaming

4.  someone usually gets the shortest end of the stick
